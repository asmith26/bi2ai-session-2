    "In our last session we learned that a good way to do an initial exploration of ordinal and categorical data is to look at plots, counts, crosstabs and correlations. A good tool in pandas is to use \"groupby\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The .groupby() function allows us to group records into buckets by categorical values, such as religious, affair, and yrs_married in this dataset. It gets a bit tricky when working with this. If you just run df.groupby('something') this will return something quite useless, i.e. a DataFrameGroupBy object. You can think of that object as instructions on how to group, but without instructions on how to display values, so you could say it's a bit unfinished.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create something useful, you need to provide instructions on what values to display. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re grouping your data by non-affairs and people with affairs. You now need to tell the function what to do with the other values. You could do any number of things, like, take the average value of all observations with .mean(), sum them all up with .sum(), take the maximum value with .max(), etc. \n",

    "Some of the features, such as the age of a woman are more or less continuous (technically they are integer so not continuous because we don't have their 'exact' age but let's gloss over that). \n",
    "\n",
    "Other features such as a woman or her partner's occupation are categorical. If somebody has occupation type 2, that does not make their job \"more\" similar to somebody of job type 1 than job type 5. For that reason, this is generally dealt with by a feature engineering technique called making \"dummy variables\". The general idea is to get rid of a column which contains such categorical entries, and make new columns for each possible value. Because there are 6 possible occupations, this would result in making six columns labelled \"Job 1\" , \"Job 2\" etc. If somebody is in occupation 2, they get an entry of 1 in the \"Job 2\" column and 0 elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Patsy library used in this notebook to do this goes one step further and notes that as there are 6 occupations, we can get away with 5 columns because if all 5 job columns for one person are zero, they must have the sixth occupation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The synatx of patsy's dmatrices function is to denote features with a categorical with a C before them. Features which are continuous are just denoted by their name. The ~ between affair and the rest of the features denotes that affair is the target variable/label and everything subsequent are features.\n",

This is somewhat prone to over fitting, as the data we are querying is already contained within the data the model was trained against. In a sense, the model has already seen these cases. A better test of model validity is the split the data into a training and a test set. Sci-kit learn has a nice function called train_test_split which splits data into test and training sets of user defined sizes, and does so selecting randomly from the global set (without replacement). You've already seen this in action in the Linear Regression notebook.\n",
